What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    Browser sends GET requests
    HTTP headers also sent
    Status codes returns 200
    Server/Internet sends back HTTP response with HTTP Headers for each request
    Looks like 4 GETs and one OPTION request happened
    One GET failed because of my Adblock

Looked at answers and it seems some of my answers were off the mark.
